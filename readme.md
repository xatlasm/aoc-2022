# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to [AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Each day's solutions are in their own folder within `packages`. Click through to see each one.

## Prerequisites

I use top-level `await` to read the input files, so node >= 14.8 is recommended.

## Installation

Because this is a monorepo, you should only need to run `npm install` at the root folder only, not inside each `packages` subfolder.

Enjoy!
